## Project Summary <a name="summary"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in performing EDA on Airbnb data (specificially for NYC from 2018 and 2019) to better understand the following:

1. Which NYC areas have the most listings?
2. What does availability for listings look like throughout the year?
3. How do listing prices vary by location?
4. How do listing prices change throughout the year?

You can view the in-depth analysis, code, and results in the notebook on nbviewer [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/f1ndx/Udacity-DataScience-Nanodegree/blob/master/Airbnb%20NYC%20EDA/Airbnb_NYC_EDA.ipynb). The key analysis findings are also briefly discussed in [this](https://medium.com/@atanasoffa/exploring-airbnb-in-nyc-68a9ce0e0101) Medium post.

## Data <a name="data"></a>

All of the Airbnb data files can be downloaded from Inside Airbnb's public archives: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html.

The NYC-specific data files used in this project:

* [calendar_june2018.csv](http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-states/ny/new-york-city/2018-06-03/data/calendar.csv.gz), [calendar_oct2018.csv](http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-states/ny/new-york-city/2018-10-03/data/calendar.csv.gz), and [calendar_june2019.csv](http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-states/ny/new-york-city/2019-06-02/data/calendar.csv.gz) - csv's containing detailed calendar data for NYC listings such as `listing_id`, `date`, `availability`, and `price` per listing
* [listings_june2018.csv](http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-states/ny/new-york-city/2018-06-03/data/listings.csv.gz), [listings_june2019.csv](http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-states/ny/new-york-city/2019-06-02/data/listings.csv.gz) - csv's containing neighborhood-related features such as `neighbourhood_cleansed` and `neighbourhood_group_cleansed` (i.e. "borough") per listing ID

## Repo Files <a name="files"></a>

* **Airbnb_NYC_EDA.ipynb** - Jupyter notebook containing the project code and in-depth analysis for the above questions; follows the CRISP-DM process

* **Airbnb_NYC_EDA.html** - HTML export of the notebook, Airbnb_NYC_EDA.ipynb

* **iframe_figures/** - folder containing the HTML files generated by Plotly's interactive `iframe_connected` renderer (for all Plotly figures in the notebook)

  * <u>Note</u>: Switching to the "iframe_connected" renderer *significantly* reduces the
    notebook size since it stores the figure data in individual HTML files instead of inline. Plotly doc on Renderers: https://plotly.com/python/renderers/

* `numpy`
* `pandas`
* `matplotlib` 
* `seaborn` 
* `plotly`(used to generate a majority of the interactive plots)
* `datetime`
* `calendar`
* `os`
