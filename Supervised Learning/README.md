# Finding Donors Project
**Summary:** In this project, I employed several supervised learning algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census (data not included here). I chose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimized said algorithm to best model the data. 

The goal with this implementation was to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000 which could then indicate a potentially viable donor for a fictitious charity organization.
